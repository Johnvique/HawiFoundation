      <p>Getting admissions into a good medical school has been a challenge to many as the
focus is not only on good grades but also the ability to holistically fit into the
healthcare community. That is why Hawi foundation prides itself of the best medical elective
programs in Africa, one which is built by experience- rich Healthcare practitioners
and focused on inoculcating an early service spirit to aspiring medical students even
as they get exposed to various cases which they otherwise wouldn’t interact with in
their own countries. We therefore use the funds accumulated from charity work to sponsor the medical electives and internship programs.</p>
